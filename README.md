# AlertHub-API
Here lives the API that powers the AlertHub mobile app.

AlertHub is a mobile application that informs registered users and also other stakeholders about emergency situations, such as fires, tornadoes, hailstorms, etc. 
The notification is done through a text message to a set of recipients (if certain criteria are met). Each notification includes the emergency situation (with any information
the geographical location of the current event, a timestamp (date/time), and instructions from the civil protection.

<br/>

The management of the application is done by admins through a web portal made in Next .Js
